            <p>Here's what do we know: the CDC is listing most regions as safe. Health <br>officials are saying good hygiene habits make a big difference, too. <br><br>
                what we do know yet is how this situation will impact our upcoming <br>
               company -wide retreat. We'll be tracking CDC updates and news reports <br> and we'll let you know if anything changes. Expect to get another email <br>
               from me with an update on friday. <br> <br>
               In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to me, your manager <br>or HR if you have any questions or concerns at all. <br><br> we're all here to support you. Stay safe! <br> <br>
